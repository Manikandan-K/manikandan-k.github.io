Open Source Contribution:
----------------------------------------

I developed open source library Jdbi-folder which removes the need of any intermediate mappers for ResultSet to Java object conversion in JDBI. It provides annotations like OneToOne and OneToMany (famous in Hibernate), through which it will takes care of complex multi level parent child relationships. It improved our team productivity significantly. I did give the talk in Geeknight Chennai about this library. Currently it is used in many countries.
